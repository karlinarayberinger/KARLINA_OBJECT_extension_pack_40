The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place between the hours of 12:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 24_MAY_2025 and 11:59PM Pacific Standard Time on 26_MAY_2025. That conversation pertains to the generation of an image which karbytes thinks is reminiscent of the week-long period karbytes spent drafting the files which are now part of the chapter of karbytes named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40.

karbytes:

Generate an image of a transparent cube which is made of smaller transparent cubes and which has within it bright glowing greenish yellow dots which appear to be traveling in straight lines and sometimes making 90 degree angle changes to traverse different axes of the cube's underlying Cartesian grid space. Make the background appear to be some expanse of deep space full of stars, galaxies, and nebulae. The cube should look reminiscent of some kind of futuristic computer technology. Add lots of green dot trajectories to emphasize that cube's depth.

Excellent! I plan to use this image to represent the release of the chapter of karbytes named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40 on 26_MAY_2025 after taking a week-long hiatus from updating karbytes and then going on another hiatus lasting between one and eight weeks. During that time, karbytes will likely be working on drafts for new content in private GitHub repositories and in the public development_space repository and/or taking time to work on offline activities pertaining to karbytes’ welfare and survival.

Noted. Let me know if you’d like help preparing the official release materials for KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40 or documenting the hiatus plans.
