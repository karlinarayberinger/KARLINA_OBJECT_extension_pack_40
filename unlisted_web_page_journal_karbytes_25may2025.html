<p>This journal entry is a follow-up to the journal entry at the following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uniform Resource Locator</a>:</p>
<p><a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/journal_karbytes_24may2025_p0.txt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/journal_karbytes_24may2025_p0.txt</a></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>After doing some research online about various ways physical property is transferred from a deceased (or soon to be deceased) owner of that property to some other person (or organization), I concluded that the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-DISC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">M_DISCs</a> I want to preserve following my death and which contain backups of the <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_26may2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes</a> file collection are not items which museums nor individuals other than myself would want to acquire.</p>
<p>Rather than leave those discs to be dealt with by whoever clears out whatever belongings I leave behind wherever I am living, I decided that the most feasible and secure means of preserving those M_DISCs is putting them inside of an air-tight metal <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_capsule" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time capsule</a> and burying it in the ground somewhere relatively remote and part of a wilderness preserve (i.e. a region which the government basically owns and has forbidden converting into housing or commercial locations).</p>
<p>Before I bury an M_DISC collection somewhere, I will make <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/journal_karbytes_25may2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a blog post</a> about it on karbytes which specifies the longitude and latitude coordinates of the time capsule burial site (in Planet Earth&#8217;s lithosphere). I plan to do that within the next thirty years (and I am likely to make my first karbytes time capsule some time within the next five years as soon as I scope out a decent burial site and obtain a suitable container to put my M_DISCs in)).</p>
<p>To avoid making the burial site stand out from the environment around it (i.e. to make it as hidden as possible (aside from disclosing its location in a blog post)), I do not plan on placing any special markers near the time capsule. That is to prevent vandals from tampering with the time capsule. I think that people who read my blog and that particular blog post announcing a particular karbytes time capsule burial are likely to honor my wishes to leave that time capsule alone (unless they work for a museum and think that what I have created is worthy of being permanently included in that museum&#8217;s collection of historical artifacts from human civilization).</p>
<p>Of course, <span style="background: #00ffff">an M_DISC is not designed to last more than approximately one thousand years. If and when superior archival-quality digital storage media become available to hobbyists such as myself, I will use those new and improved storage media in place of M_DISCs. Even if the time capsules I bury only contain M_DISCs, I have some peace of mind knowing that at least karbytes in solid-state form is in a relatively safe and undisturbed location for at least a few hundred years (and likely hundreds of years after my death).</span></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In case I do not get the opportunity to update karbytes after the finalization of karbytes2025_13, I would like to disclose to the public now that, before the end of this year, I plan on placing a time capsule containing backups of karbytes2025_13 (or a later version of karbytes) in the Las Trampas Wilderness at within a twenty feet of the point on Earth&#8217;s surface labeled the following (according to Google Earth): 37°50&#8217;01&#8243;N 122°03&#8217;56&#8243;W</p>
<p>An image of that (tentative) burial site for karbytes&#8217; first time capsule is available at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_google_earth_coordinates_25may2025.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_google_earth_coordinates_25may2025.png</a></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>An alternative burial site for karbytes&#8217; first time capsule (other than the aforementioned location at Las Trampas Wilderness near San Ramon, California) is a location karbytes is more familiar with and which is within walking distance of where karbytes currently lives (at the highest point of the trail which starts at Chabot Staging Area in Castro Valley, California and which karbytes has referred to as &#8220;Ramage Peak&#8221; in older journal entries). That &#8220;Ramage Peak&#8221; location is described by the following longitude and latitude coordinates: 37°45&#8217;20&#8243;N 122°04&#8217;05&#8243;W</p>
<p>An image of that (tentative) burial site for karbytes&#8217; first time capsule is available at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_alternative_site_google_earth_coordinates_25may2025.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_alternative_site_google_earth_coordinates_25may2025.png</a></p>
<p>Finally, details about so-called &#8220;Ramage Peak&#8221; (which might not be the official name of that location) are available in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/map_of_karbytes_home_environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/map_of_karbytes_home_environment/</a></p>

<p><span style="background: #00ffff">After thinking about the pragmatic aspects of burying my first karbytes M_DISC time capsule (which will tentatively exclusively contain the version of karbytes named <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">karbytes2025_13</a> (and be buried near the surface of Earth&#8217;s lithosphere within the next 30 days)), I decided that perhaps the best place to bury that time capsule is in either one of my parents&#8217; backyards (especially the backyard at my mom&#8217;s house at the base of the only redwood tree on that property within three feet of my deceased cat&#8217;s tombstone</span> (and his corpse was buried beneath the rock which was placed on top of the location that corpse was wrapped in a towel, placed in a hole approximately two feet deep, and then covered with dirt approximately thirty years ago)). I&#8217;ll provide the longitude and latitude coordinates of those two prospective time capsule burial locations along with photographs and/or <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Earth" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Earth</a> screenshots of those locations in the next section of this note.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The most likely place where karbytes is burying its first time capsule (which consists of an unlocked metal safe containing a green &#8220;fire-proof&#8221; and &#8220;water-proof&#8221; zip-locking compact disc container containing a spindle of six to ten M_DISCs which each contain exclusively the file collection named karbytes2025_13 (whose contents are enumerated at the following Uniform Resource Locator: <a style="background: #000000;color: #00ff00" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_13/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/mdisc_karbytes2025_13/</a>) insulated with cloth towels and a plastic bag sealed shut with duct tape) is <span style="background: #00ffff">at the base of the redwood tree on the right side of the rock which is depicted by the following images and located at the residential address 18618 Crest Avenue, Castro Valley, California 94546 and at the approximate longitude and latitude coordinates 37°42&#8217;30&#8243;N 122°06&#8217;19&#8243;W.</span></p>

<p>* * *</p>
<p>The aforementioned time capsule container is depicted by the following photograph (but the compact disc container which will be containing karbytes2025_13 M_DISCs will be green instead of blue): <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_metal_box_and_compact_disc_case_25may2025.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_metal_box_and_compact_disc_case_25may2025.jpg</a></p>
<p>Additional M_DISC copies of karbytes2025_13 (and newer versions of karbytes) will be stored in the microwave oven in karbytes&#8217; room (at the residential address 4757 Mira Vista Place, Castro Valley, California 94546) as depicted by the following photograph: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_room_copies_microwave_oven_container_25may2025.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_room_copies_microwave_oven_container_25may2025.jpg</a></p>
<p>When that microwave oven becomes full, the newest backups of karbytes will be placed in that microwave oven while the oldest karbytes backups in that microwave oven will be moved to the plastic &#8220;overflow&#8221; storage bins as depicted by the following photograph: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_room_copies_overflow_plastic_storage_bins_25may2025.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_40/main/karbytes_first_time_capsule_room_copies_overflow_plastic_storage_bins_25may2025.jpg</a></p>
